This repository contains a solution for the "Interactive Navigation Menu" task as part of the internship at Prodigy Info Tech. The task involves creating a navigation menu with dynamic styling effects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Key features of this project include:

Interactive Navigation Menu: Implemented using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.
Dynamic Styling: The navigation menu changes color or style in response to scrolling or hovering over menu items.
Fixed Position: The navigation menu remains fixed and visible on all pages.
Modular Code: Organized code structure for easy understanding and maintenance.
Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback or suggestions for improvement.
